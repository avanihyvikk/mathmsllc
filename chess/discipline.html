                <p>At our chess camp, our foremost objective is to deliver high-quality chess instruction and foster competitive experiences for all participants. Any significant interference by one or more participants that impedes this process is considered detrimental to the overall group dynamic and will not be tolerated. While we provide guidance to occasional offenders, we are not equipped, nor obligated, to address persistent disruptions, especially those involving physical harm or property damage.</p>
                <p>Parents should understand that our camps may not be suitable for every child. We maintain a focused and disciplined environment, unsuitable for casual play or disruptive behavior. Consequently, children under the age of 7 are generally not admitted unless recommended by local chess educators for their serious commitment to the game. Beginners are expected to grasp fundamental chess rules and algebraic notation. Participants should anticipate a comprehensive chess immersion to develop their skills commensurate with their abilities and maturity.</p>
                <p>By signing below, as the parent or legal guardian of the minor, I consent to Cedar Park Mathnasium staff, chess camp instructors, and volunteers employing appropriate disciplinary measures when necessary. Our disciplinary protocol entails:</p>
               <br><br> <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                    <li>First offense: Issuance of a behavioral warning to the minor.</li>
                    <li>Second offense: Direct discussion with the undersigned parent/guardian or other provided contact.</li>
                    <li>Third offense: Dismissal of the minor from the camp, promptly facilitated by their removal from the premises.</li>
                </ul>
                <br><br><p>Any significant acts of physical or emotional aggression, or property damage, may result in immediate dismissal and removal by the undersigned guardian.</p>
